With a background in ornithology, geographic information science, and recent experience with machine learning, I enjoy sitting at the intersection of avian ecology and data science, working collaboratively to architect, scale, and deploy machine learning to generate usable data products for managing and conserving bird populations.\nGithub\nGoogle Scholar\nLinkedIn\neBird Profile\nBluesky\n\n\n\nEducation\nMSc Geography, 2009 The Pennsylvania State University\nBSc Biology, 2005 University of Minnesotaâ€“Duluth\n\n\nInterests & Experience\nSpecies Distribution Modeling\nMachine Learning (Predictive and Explainable)\nRandom Forests\nData Science Product Management\nMLOps\nParticipatory Science\nRemote Sensing\nGeovisualization\nGeographic Information Science\nOrnithology"
