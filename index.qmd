### About

I help lead a team of data scientists and engineers that translate raw participatory science data (eBird) into actionable data products about avian biodiversity (eBird Status and Trends). With a background in ornithology, geographic information science, and recent experience with machine learning, I enjoy sitting at the intersection of avian ecology and data science, working collaboratively to architect, scale, and deploy machine learning to generate usable data products for managing and conserving bird populations.
