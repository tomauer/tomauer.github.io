Along with contributing to publications that support projects I work on, in my role as a product manager I particularly enjoy giving presentations and workshops, where I work to help translate the complex data science projects I work on into understandable stories for a range of audiences, with a goal of helping people buy-in to the work and data products generated. I'm always interested in opportunities for giving presentations on my current work and also am interested in potential podcast or radio opportunities, especially at the intersection of birds, participatory science, and data science. Please feel free to [contact me](mailto:mthomasauer@gmail.com) about either of these opportunitites.

Below is a selection of presentations I've given at various conferences, workshops, and seminars. These presentations showcase my work and insights across a range of topics.
